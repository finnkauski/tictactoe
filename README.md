# A `tic-tac-toe` game in Haskell

Greetings, not sure how you stumbled upon to this repo, but this is an exercise
in developing a tictactoe game in haskell. Time and motivation allowing, I will
proceed to implement something like [Ultimate Tic Tac
Toe](http://bejofo.net/ttt) with a working GUI.

## Current status:

It should be a bare bones, working example of a tic tac toe game in haskell. Perhaps it doesn't use fancy patterns but I'm here to learn.

## Next immediate steps:

- Unit tests (learn how to do them in haskell)
- Better player feedback
- CI
- Code Cov

## Longer term steps

- UI (perhaps a web UI)
- Networking
- AI ??
